`consent-text`: `<string>` ::

Consent text that is displayed before logging in.

`console`: `<applet | html5 | vv | xtermjs>` ::

Select the default Console viewer. You can either use the builtin java applet (VNC; deprecated and maps to html5), an external virt-viewer comtatible application (SPICE), an HTML5 based vnc viewer (noVNC), or an HTML5 based console client (xtermjs). If the selected viewer is not available (e.g. SPICE not activated for the VM), the fallback is noVNC.

`crs`: `[ha=<basic|static>] [,ha-rebalance-on-start=<1|0>]` ::

Cluster resource scheduling settings.

`ha`=`<basic | static>` ('default =' `basic`);;

Configures how the HA manager should select nodes to start or recover services. With 'basic', only the number of services is used, with 'static', static CPU and memory configuration of services is considered.

`ha-rebalance-on-start`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Set to use CRS for selecting a suited node when a HA services request-state changes from stop to start.

`description`: `<string>` ::

Datacenter description. Shown in the web-interface datacenter notes panel. This is saved as comment inside the configuration file.

`email_from`: `<string>` ::

Specify email address to send notification from (default is root@$hostname)

`fencing`: `<both | hardware | watchdog>` ('default =' `watchdog`)::

Set the fencing mode of the HA cluster. Hardware mode needs a valid configuration of fence devices in /etc/pve/ha/fence.cfg. With both all two modes are used.
+
WARNING: 'hardware' and 'both' are EXPERIMENTAL & WIP

`ha`: `shutdown_policy=<enum>` ::

Cluster wide HA settings.

`shutdown_policy`=`<conditional | failover | freeze | migrate>` ('default =' `conditional`);;

Describes the policy for handling HA services on poweroff or reboot of a node. Freeze will always freeze services which are still located on the node on shutdown, those services won't be recovered by the HA manager. Failover will not mark the services as frozen and thus the services will get recovered to other nodes, if the shutdown node does not come up again quickly (< 1min). 'conditional' chooses automatically depending on the type of shutdown, i.e., on a reboot the service will be frozen but on a poweroff the service will stay as is, and thus get recovered after about 2 minutes. Migrate will try to move all running services to another node when a reboot or shutdown was triggered. The poweroff process will only continue once no running services are located on the node anymore. If the node comes up again, the service will be moved back to the previously powered-off node, at least if no other migration, reloaction or recovery took place.

`http_proxy`: `http://.*` ::

Specify external http proxy which is used for downloads (example: 'http://username:password@host:port/')

Default GUI language.

`mac_prefix`: `<string>` ('default =' `BC:24:11`)::

Prefix for the auto-generated MAC addresses of virtual guests. The default `BC:24:11` is the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE to Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH for a MAC Address Block Large (MA-L). You're allowed to use this in local networks, i.e., those not directly reachable by the public (e.g., in a LAN or NAT/Masquerading).
 
Note that when you run multiple cluster that (partially) share the networks of their virtual guests, it's highly recommended that you extend the default MAC prefix, or generate a custom (valid) one, to reduce the chance of MAC collisions. For example, add a separate extra hexadecimal to the Proxmox OUI for each cluster, like `BC:24:11:0` for the first, `BC:24:11:1` for the second, and so on.
 Alternatively, you can also separate the networks of the guests logically, e.g., by using VLANs.
+
For publicly accessible guests it's recommended that you get your own https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/[OUI from the IEEE] registered or coordinate with your, or your hosting providers, network admins.

Migration traffic is encrypted using an SSH tunnel by default. On secure, completely private networks this can be disabled to increase performance.

`migration_unsecure`: `<boolean>` ::

Migration is secure using SSH tunnel by default. For secure private networks you can disable it to speed up migration. Deprecated, use the 'migration' property instead!

`next-id`: `[lower=<integer>] [,upper=<integer>]` ::

Privilege options for user-settable tags

`user-allow`=`<existing | free | list | none>` ('default =' `free`);;

* 'existing' like list, but already existing tags of resources are also usable.
