Storage pool type: `glusterfs`

GlusterFS is a scalable network file system. The system uses a modular
design, runs on commodity hardware, and can provide a highly available
enterprise storage at low costs. Such system is capable of scaling to
several petabytes, and can handle thousands of clients.

NOTE: After a node/brick crash, GlusterFS does a full `rsync` to make
sure data is consistent. This can take a very long time with large
files, so this backend is not suitable to store large VM images.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backend supports all common storage properties, and adds the
following GlusterFS specific options:

`server`::

GlusterFS volfile server IP or DNS name.

`server2`::

Backup volfile server IP or DNS name.

`volume`::

GlusterFS Volume.

`transport`::

GlusterFS transport: `tcp`, `unix` or `rdma`


.Configuration Example (`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`)
----
glusterfs: Gluster
        server 10.2.3.4
        server2 10.2.3.5
	volume glustervol
	content images,iso
----


File naming conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory layout and the file naming conventions are inherited
from the `dir` backend.


Storage Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The storage provides a file level interface, but no native
snapshot/clone implementation.
