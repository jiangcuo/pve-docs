CIFS Backend

:title: Storage: CIFS

Storage pool type: `cifs`

The CIFS backend extends the directory backend, so that no manual
setup of a CIFS mount is needed. Such a storage can be added directly
through the {pve} API or the web UI, with all our backend advantages,
like server heartbeat check or comfortable selection of exported
shares.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backend supports all common storage properties, except the shared
flag, which is always set. Additionally, the following CIFS special
properties are available:

server::

Server IP or DNS name. Required.

TIP: To avoid DNS lookup delays, it is usually preferable to use an IP
address instead of a DNS name - unless you have a very reliable DNS
server, or list the server in the local `/etc/hosts` file.

share::

CIFS share to use (get available ones with `pvesm scan cifs <address>` or the
web UI). Required.

username::

The username for the CIFS storage. Optional, defaults to `guest'.

password::

The user password. Optional.
It will be saved in a file only readable by root
(`/etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.pw`).

domain::

Sets the user domain (workgroup) for this storage. Optional.

smbversion::

SMB protocol Version. Optional, default is `3`.
SMB1 is not supported due to security issues.

path::

The local mount point. Optional, defaults to `/mnt/pve/<STORAGE_ID>/`.

content-dirs::

Overrides for the default directory layout. Optional.

options::

Additional CIFS mount options (see `man mount.cifs`). Some options are set
automatically and shouldn't be set here. {pve} will always set the option
`soft`. Depending on the configuration, these options are set automatically:
`username`, `credentials`, `guest`, `domain`, `vers`.

subdir::

The subdirectory of the share to mount. Optional, defaults to the root directory
of the share.

.Configuration Example (`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`)
----
cifs: backup
	path /mnt/pve/backup
	server 10.0.0.11
	share VMData
	content backup
	options noserverino,echo_interval=30
	username anna
	smbversion 3
	subdir /data

Storage Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CIFS does not support snapshots on a storage level. But you may use
`qcow2` backing files if you still want to have snapshots and cloning
features available.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

You can get a list of exported CIFS shares with:

----
# pvesm scan cifs <server> [--username <username>] [--password]
----

Then you can add one of these shares as a storage to the whole {pve} cluster
with:

----
# pvesm add cifs <storagename> --server <server> --share <share> [--username <username>] [--password]
