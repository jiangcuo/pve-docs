Proxmox provides updates on a regular basis for all repositories. To install
updates use the web-based GUI or the following CLI commands:

----
# apt-get update
# apt-get dist-upgrade
----

For occasionally upgrading Ceph to its succeeding major release, see
xref:sysadmin_package_repositories_ceph[Ceph Repositories].

NOTE: The APT package management system is very flexible and provides many
features, see `man apt-get`, or <<Hertzog13>> for additional information.

TIP: Regular updates are essential to get the latest patches and security
related fixes. Major system upgrades are announced in the {forum}.
