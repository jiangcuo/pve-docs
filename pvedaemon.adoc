pvedaemon - Proxmox VE API Daemon
=================================
endif::manvolnum[]

This daemon exposes the whole {pve} API on `127.0.0.1:85`. It runs as
`root` and has permission to do all privileged operations.

NOTE: The daemon listens to a local address only, so you cannot access
it from outside. The `pveproxy` daemon exposes the API to the outside
world.

[[pvedaemon_max_workers]]
Number of Workers
-----------------

`pvedaemon` delegates handling of incoming requests to worker processes. By
default, `pvedaemon` spawns 3 worker processes, which is sufficient for most
workloads. For automation-heavy workloads that issue a huge volume of API
requests and that experience slow request handling or timeouts, the number of
worker processes can be increased by setting `MAX_WORKERS` in
`/etc/default/pvedaemon`, for example:

 MAX_WORKERS=5

Note that a higher number of worker processes may result in higher CPU usage.
The number of worker processes must be greater than 0 and smaller than 128.

The same setting exists for xref:pveproxy_max_workers[pveproxy].
